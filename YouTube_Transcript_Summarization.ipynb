              "\" ah yeah get ready to laugh in this lesson we're learning english with barack obama ex-president in the united states on jimmy kimmel live by the way if you're new here every week we help you to understand fast speaking natives just like obama without getting lost without missing the jokes and without subtitles like hiroyuki who says that our lessons have helped him to understand his favorite movies without subtitles so if you want to get confident listening to it's really simple just hit that subscribe button and the bell below so you don't miss any of our new lessons [Music] so when you're at home can you like can you run down to the kitchen in your underpants in the middle of the night if you're hungry i mean i could i i don't you don't no is there someone in the kitchen at all times like if you wanted a sandwich in the night would you have to wake someone up yeah i wouldn't wake somebody up to have a sandwich you're allowed to go in the refrigerator on your own i am there there's there's a refrigerator and and there's silverware when was the last time you you actually cooked uh now it's been a while since it's been a while i i won't lie about that you ever drive i cannot drive i mean i i'm i'm able to drive is gonna have a birth certificate in kenya we drive on the other side [Music] so when you're at home can you like can you run down to the kitchen in your underpants in the middle of the night if you're hungry jimmy is well aware that all these questions he's asking barack obama are quite silly however the reason he's asking these questions is probably because people might often wonder to what extent a president goes through the same routine a normal person does in his or her everyday life does he actually ever make himself a sandwich does he drive himself somewhere when he needs to does he cook his own food so the first question is whether he goes particularly at night and in his underpants to the kitchen for a sandwich when he's hungry so underpants are these he says run down to the kitchen which is the same as go to the kitchen let's see how people use this in these other examples no it's fine manny i can run down the store right now and get a stupid jeweler hi jay don't scream at him it was an honest mistake so you know in horror movies when the girl's like oh my god there's something in the basement let me just run down there in my underwear and see what's going on in the dark and you're like what is your problem call the police you're allowed to go in the refrigerator on your own i am there's there's a refrigerator and and there's silverware if you're allowed to do something you have permission to do it all right let's prepare for the day tonight here's the things you're not allowed to talk about love poetry music or passion again with presidents the question is whether they must have official staff do everything for them as we're learning from obama he doesn't he can get his food on his own if he wants if you do something on your own you do it without any help listen to me i need to do this on my own if i fail i fail if i pass i pass do you get it this is different from to be on your own which means that you're alone for god's sake he's on his own for two days and he joins a gang silverware is a word that refers to knives forks spoons etc made of steel or other materials example can you put the silverware on the table when was the last time you you actually cooked uh now it's been a while since it's been a while a while is an unspecified period of time when we say it's been a while we mean that a long time has passed since you last did something we usually follow this up with sense it's been a while since i read an actual newspaper miss that sound this is also something you can say when you meet someone you haven't seen in a long time well hey sheldon it's been a while uh now it's been a while since it's been a while i i won't lie about that i won't lie or i'm not going to lie is a phrase that we say when we want to emphasize that we're being honest example your cake was way better than mine i'm not gonna lie i won't lie the movie was better than i expected do you ever drive i cannot drive i mean i i'm i'm able to drive when we say that we know how to do something we often use the verb can so if you say i can swim you're saying that you're able to do it as seen here it can be ambiguous at times in this clip this can mean different things for example that he isn't allowed to drive or that he does not know how to drive to avoid the misunderstanding he says he's able to drive meaning he has the ability to do so but probably because of security reasons as a president he was not permitted to drive vehicles hey would you like to understand natives no matter how fast we

just click up here or down description below to learn more and sign up we look forward to meeting you inside is that actually i don't have a birth certificate there used to be rumors that barack obama was not born in the u.s and therefore he could not be president some allegations stated that he was born in kenya which is where his father is from in just a few short weeks donald trump's stance on where president obama was born has well evolved from this the reason i have a little doubt just a little just a little is because he grew up and nobody knew him to this i want him to show his worship i'm saying it's a real possibility much greater than i thought two or three weeks ago then he has pulled one of the great cons in the history of politics and beyond politics in those same three weeks trump's poll numbers have gone from this to this nearly doubling in less than a month i suspect that some of my critics back home are suggesting that i'm back here to look for my birth certificate that is not the case obama later released a copy of his birth certificate that showed he was born in hawaii so in this clip they're joking about this funny and ridiculous incident we're now going to focus on some of the connected speech in this clip jimmy starts off this interview saying when you're at home can you distinctly hear at in that utterance can you say it without over pronouncing it at is a structure word and most times we say it in its weak form so we don't say act we say uh let's take a look at some examples are you mad at me no i'm not mad at you i just yeah well at least i didn't suck at customer relations then he says i i won't lie about that here the t gets reduced to the point it almost loses all its presence so this sounds like i won't the rest sounds like why about that this t because it's before a th sound isn't pronounced let's listen to these two sentences again and take the chance to mimic how they say it when you're at home so when you're at home i i won't lie about that i i i won't lie about that i i won't lie about that actually the last time i drove uh a former staffer came by and and he comes through the the south lawn and he's got uh one of these uh new electric cars at the time they were new yeah and and he was very excited about it i said well yeah let's try it out so i i just grab his keys and we just go out it's parked right in front and i start circling the south lawn and the secret service there no matter what you do do not let him out and they uh they they they were pretty upset they so they call you renegade right is that there yeah yeah because you're tooling around in an electric car topping speeds of 30 miles an hour yeah i i think i think we have 35. yeah if you have to go to the dentist does do you go to the dentist comes to me dennis comes to you you have the chair and the tools you've got the hole in the chair everything is all there everything is there in the basement i didn't know i showed up i said you know i think uh you know i've got uh a cap that's loose sir here we are do you reset the clocks with daylight saving time happens somebody else does that somebody does that for you will you get rid of daylight saving time or at least get rid of the part where we have to wake up earlier you can leave the other one well see this is a california thing because you guys are always getting sun yeah in the east coast you don't mind losing that hour because that's a signal that spring is here we only care about ourselves [Music] actually the last time i drove a former staffer came by and he comes through the the south lawn a staffer is a member of a staff he's referring to the white house staff which is the group of people who work in this institution look look i talked to corporate about protecting the sales staff and they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing okay but there's no downsizing so just don't bottom line do i need to be worried maybe now he says former staffer because this person doesn't work in the white house anymore at the moment of this interview barack obama was the president of the united states nowadays we could say that he's the former president and that the current president is donald trump a lawn is a common part of american house it is the area of grass in front of one's house for example the chore of cutting this grass is called mowing the lawn so the south lawn refers to the area of land to the south of the white house by the way did you notice how he starts telling this story in the past a former staffer came by however then he switches to the present tense even though he's talking about a past event and and he comes through the the south along have you ever wondered why a native might do this well we explained this in our recent lesson with finding nemo you can watch that and learn how to tell a story in english after you finish this lesson and he was very excited about it i said well yeah let's try it out if you're excited about something you're very enthusiastic and eager we say excited about something and excited to do something let's check out these examples with each what's going on we're just really excited about this charity event that we have to go er what are you doing here your hair is sweating that's cause i'm excited to see my friends let's go buddy to try something out means to try use or consider something in order to make a decision or form an opinion about it and the secret service no matter what you do do not let him out the united states secret service is the body of law enforcement tasked with protecting the nation's leaders and their families we use no matter what to say that you will definitely do something or not do something as is the case here i support her decision that's what good detectives do they have each other's back no matter what hey would you like to learn more with ex-president obama well we have a hilarious lesson that you're going to love with him and president trump that you can watch after you finish this video by clicking up here or down in the description below they they were pretty upset they so they call you renegade right is that their yeah yeah because you're tooling around in an electric car if someone is upset they are unhappy disappointed or worried because of something oh god i know i'm pathetic i'm a loser honey you're not pathetic you're just you're sad yeah i mean people do stupid things when they're upset my god if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn't in this case a renegade is someone who is rebellious and acts unconventionally as you may know obama is famous for not doing things traditionally thought of as typical behavior for a president we can see this just by the fact that he participated in a comedy program like jimmy kimmel live or roasting trump in this other lesson we did with him because you're tooling around in an electric car the phrasal verb to tool around means to drive around in a casual or fun manner rather than to arrive at some destination stopping speeds of 30 miles an hour i i think i think we have 35. as a verb to top means to reach a maximum limit so if a car tops the speed of 30 miles per hour it means that the maximum speed that a car can reach is 30 miles per hour what they mean here is that obama probably didn't drive over 30 miles per hour as he was just driving around the property of the white house which is actually quite responsible of him despite what the secret service thought he jokes that he thinks they actually hit 35 meaning they achieved 35 miles per hour oh speaking of good news somebody just hit 100 twitter followers [Music] you got the whole chair everything is all there everything is there in the basement i didn't know setup is a very common phrasal verb that means to arrange organize or prepare example we need to set up a meeting we also say that something is set up meaning it is prepared or ready to be used obama is saying that the white house has a dentist chair set up in its basement the basement is the room or area in a building that is under the level of the ground do you reset the clocks with daylight saving time the phrasal verb we've just seen set up derives from the verb set which is even wider in uses and meanings one of such uses is to say the phrase to set a clock meaning to change or adjust the time in a clock reset means to set again let's explore some different uses of this verb man i've never seen you work this hard at anything ever it's because i care so much i set an alarm for 5 00 am every time i wanted food i rebooted my sister are you ready to reboot when i feel a food craving i would dunk my head into ice water and reset my brain watch me will you get rid of daylight saving time if you get rid of something you throw it away or don't use it anymore well i just can't believe that she and i are about to get rid of all of her stuff her whole life is down there no i wouldn't think i'd like that we really need to get rid of this stuff so do you want this crap or not daylight savings time is the practice of advancing clocks during warmer months so that darkness falls later each day according to the clock so when you're at home can you like can you run down to the kitchen in your underpants in the middle of the night if you're hungry i mean i could i i don't you don't no is there someone in the kitchen at all times like if you wanted a sandwich in the night would you have to wake someone up yeah i wouldn't wake somebody up to have a sandwich you're allowed to go in the refrigerator on your own [Music] i am there's there's a refrigerator and and there's silverware when was the last time you you actually cooked uh now it's been a while since it's been a while i i won't lie about that [Music] you ever drive i cannot drive i mean i i'm i'm able to drive actually certificate in kenya we drive on the other side uh actually the last time i drove uh a former staffer came by and and he comes through the the south lawn and he's got uh one of these new electric cars at the time they were new yeah and and he was very excited [Music] well yeah let's try it out so i i just grab his keys and we just go out it's parked right in front and i start circling the south lawn and the secret service there no matter what you do do not let him out and they uh they they they were pretty upset so they call you renegade right is that there because you're tooling around in an electric car topping speeds of 30 miles an hour yeah i i think i think we have 35. yeah if you have to go to the dentist does do you go to the dentist dennis comes to you do you have the chair the tools and you've got the whole chair everything is all there everything is there in the basement i didn't know i showed up i said you know

President Barack Obama is asked if he ever makes himself a sandwich, drives himself somewhere when he needs to, cooks his own food, or drives. He responds that he cannot drive, but he can get his food on his own if he has permission. \n",
            "\n",
            "When we say it's been a while, we mean that a long time has passed since you last did something. We usually follow this up with 'since', meaning that it has been a while since I read an actual newspaper - I miss that sound. \n",
            "\n",
            "When we say that we know how to do something, we often use the verb 'can'. So if you say 'I can swim', you're saying that you're able to do it. It can be ambiguous at times, as seen here. To emphasize that we're being honest, we can say 'I won't lie'. \n",
            "\n",
            "There used to be rumors that Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore he could not be President. Some allegations stated that he was born in Kenya, which is where his father is from. In just a few short weeks, Donald Trump's stance on where President Obama was born has well evolved. \n",
            "\n",
            "In the same three weeks, Trump's poll numbers have gone from this to this, nearly doubling in less than a month. Obama later released a copy of his birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii. \n",
            "\n",
            "Listen to these two sentences again and mimic how they say it when you're at home. The 't' gets reduced to the point it almost loses all its presence, so this sounds like 'I won' and the rest sounds like 'why about that?'. This 't' because it's before a 'th' sound isn't pronounced. \n",
            "\n",
            "The last time Obama drove, a former staffer came by and he came through the South Lawn. A staffer is a member of a staff. Obama jokes that he thinks they actually hit 35, meaning they achieved 35 miles per hour. As a verb, 'to top' means to reach a maximum limit, so if a car tops the speed of 30 mph, it means that the maximum speed that a car can reach is 30 mph. Obama probably didn't drive over 30 mph as he was just driving around the property of the White House. \n",
            "\n",
            "Finding Nemo was very excited about it. Obama said, 'Well, yeah, let's try it out'. If you're excited about something, you're very enthusiastic and eager. The Secret Service said, 'No matter what you do, do not let him out'. The United States Secret Service is the body of law enforcement tasked with protecting the nation's leaders and their families. \n",
            "\n",
            "A 'renegade' is someone who is rebellious and acts unconventionally. As you may know, Obama is famous for not doing things traditionally. If someone is 'upset', they are unhappy, disappointed, or worried because of something. \n",
            "\n",
            "Obama said, 'The setup is a very common phrasal verb that means to arrange, organize, or prepare'. The phrase 'to set a clock' means to change or adjust the time in a clock. 'Reset' means to set again. 'Set' derives from the verb 'set', which is even wider in uses and meanings. \n",
            "\n",
            "Daylight Savings Time is the practice of advancing clocks during warmer months so that darkness falls later each day according to the clock. Obama said, 'I just can't believe that she and I are about to get rid of all of her stuff. Her whole life is down there'. \n",
            "\n",
            "It's been a while since a former staffer came by and he came through the South Lawn and he's got one of these new electric cars. The Secret Service said, 'No matter what you do, do not let him out' and they were pretty upset, so they called him a 'renegade'. \n",
            "\n",
            "We got a hold of audio from several phone calls between President Obama and President-elect Trump. Obama said, 'In the East Coast, you don't mind losing that hour because that's a signal that spring is here. We only care about ourselves'. Ladies and gentlemen, this is incredible!\n"
